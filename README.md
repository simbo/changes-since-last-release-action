## About

This action collects all git commit messages from a git repository since the last git tag and provides them as output
list together with the last git tag.

To make the necessary information available, the repository needs to be checked out with tags and history.  
(e.g. using `actions/checkout` with `fetch-depth: 0`)

## Usage

### Inputs

| Name             | Description                                         | Type    | Default |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `line-prefix`    | prefix to add to every collected commit message     | String  | `"- "`  |
| `include-hashes` | whether or not the commit hashes should be included | Boolean | `true`  |

### Outputs

| Name       | Description                                  | Type   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `last-tag` | last tag from where on changes are collected | String |
| `log`      | collected commit messages                    | String |

If the repository does not have any tags present, `last-tag` will be _null_ and `log` will be all prior commit messages.

### Simple Example

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: üõé Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # [!] we need to checkout with tags and commit history

      - name: üìã Get Commits since last Release
        id: changes
        uses: simbo/changes-since-last-release-action@v1

      - name: üì£ Output collected Data
        run: |
          echo "Changes since ${{ steps.changes.outputs.last-tag }}:"
          echo "${{ steps.changes.outputs.log }}"
```

Output:

```txt
Changes since 0.1.0:
- 7e6b5f6 bump version
- 4aeb444 another change
- a7d21d6 fix something
```

### Example with optional Inputs

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: üõé Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # [!] we need to checkout with tags and commit history

      - name: üìã Get Commits since last Release
        id: changes
        uses: simbo/changes-since-last-release-action@v1
          with:
            line-prefix: "* "
            include-hashes: false

      - name: üì£ Output collected Data
        run: |
          echo "Changes since ${{ steps.changes.outputs.last-tag }}:"
          echo "${{ steps.changes.outputs.log }}"
```

Output:

```txt
Changes since 0.1.0:
* bump version
* another change
* fix something
```

### Example together with "Create a Release" and "Version Check" Actions

A common usecase is to use this action's output together with the actions
["Create a Release"](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-a-release) and
["Version Check"](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/version-check):

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: üõé Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # [!] we need to checkout with tags and commit history

      - name: üëÄ Check for Version Update
        id: version
        uses: EndBug/version-check@v1
        with:
          file-url: https://unpkg.com/my-awesome-package/package.json
          static-checking: localIsNew

      - name: üìã Get Commits since last Release
        if: steps.version.outputs.changed == 'true'
        id: changes
        uses: simbo/changes-since-last-release-action@v1

      - name: üéÅ Create Tag and GitHub Release
        if: steps.version.outputs.changed == 'true'
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
          release_name: Release ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
          body: |
            Changes since ${{ steps.changes.outputs.last-tag }}:
            ${{ steps.changes.outputs.log }}
```
